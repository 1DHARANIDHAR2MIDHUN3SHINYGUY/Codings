Given N Rupees. A liter plastic bottle of milk costs R1 Rupees and a liter of the glass bottle of milk costs R2 Rupees. 
But the empty glass bottle after buying can be exchanged for R3 Rupees. Find the maximum liters of milk which can be bought with N Rupees (either plastic or glass milk).

Example-1

Input

10 Vale of N

11-Value of R1 ie. price of plastic bottle

9-Value of R2 ie. price of glass bottle

8-Value of R3 Le, price of empty glass bottle

Output

2

code:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();//10 Total money available.
        int R1 = sc.nextInt();//11 Price of 1 liter of milk in a plastic bottle.
        int R2 = sc.nextInt(); //9 Price of 1 liter of milk in a glass bottle.
        int R3 = sc.nextInt(); //8 Refundable price of an empty glass bottle.
        int plasticLiters = N / R1;//The price of a plastic bottle is 11, but you only have 10 Rupees.if it price 10 rupee is 11 literally it becomes ans 1 ,then you can buy 1 litre
        
        // int GlassPrice = R2 - R3;
        int glassLiters = 0; 
        while (N >= R2) {
            glassLiters++;
            N -= (R2 - R3); //10 - 9 + 8 = 9 Rupees.again buy another bottle for 9 Rupees for this input
        }
        int maxLiters = Math.max(plasticLiters, glassLiters);
        System.out.println(maxLiters);
    }
}
